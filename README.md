# Note Taker 

# Description
When you are busy and need remember things how great would it be to have 
a simple quick note-taker application that stores simple daily notes. 
This note taker application is simple to use and will add and save 
your daily notes. For the developer this application is focusing on the 
backend by using Express.js. We also are using Node.js to create 
a server that will store the users notes on a local server.
